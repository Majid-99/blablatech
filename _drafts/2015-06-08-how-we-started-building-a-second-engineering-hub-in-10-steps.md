Ideally everybody's in the same place
Culture
No substitute for face time and being in the same building.
make it less painful
access to a new talent pool

1. Try to avoid having a second engineering hub

2. Have a strong team culture 

3. Make your team use a different language

4. Talk to people who did this already

5. Find the right person to lead the team

6. Integrate into the community

7. Hire only top talents


I want to end this article with a warning. First of all, our second engineering hub is only about to start. We'll see in a year or two how good we all did.
Second I want to say that team building is a social science, meaning that there are no rules or laws of nature. Things that work for us might not work for you, but I'm convinced that it's worth sharing our experiences in the hopes of pattern matching.
