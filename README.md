BlaBlaCar's Tech Blog - all BlaBlaCar Techies are invited to participate :)

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for the blog, an easy-to-use way of transform plain text into blogs posts.
Posts are written in [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/), it could not be easier!

Tips & Tricks
=============

1. Add new authors in the _config.yml, it's as easy as this
1. Posts (.md files) are to be saved in _posts, with the following format: 2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2. Images that belong to a post go into images, prefixed with the posts's date (e.g. 2011-12-31-happy.png) 
3. Drafts should end up in the folder _draft, without a prefixed date (e.g. new-years-eve-is-awesome.md)
