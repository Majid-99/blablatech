In case you haven't noticed, back [in September of last year](https://medium.com/blablacar-tech/welcome-e2eadb588b42) we gave our blog a new homeâ€”please head on over to [the BlaBlaCar Tech space](https://medium.com/blablacar-tech), now on Medium!

[![BlaBlaCar Tech, now on Medium](/images/2018-03-12-our-blog-has-moved/blablacar-tech-medium-320.png){:srcset="/images/2018-03-12-our-blog-has-moved/blablacar-tech-medium-320.png 320w, /images/2018-03-12-our-blog-has-moved/blablacar-tech-medium-640.png 640w, /images/2018-03-12-our-blog-has-moved/blablacar-tech-medium-desktop.png 800w"}](https://medium.com/blablacar-tech)

Older articles have not been migrated over, but they can still be found in [the archive here](/blog/) for posterity.

Don't hesitate to check out our newer [articles you may have missed](https://medium.com/blablacar-tech/archive) since the move, and be sure to follow us on Medium for all future posts!
