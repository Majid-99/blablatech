Belonging to the Blablacar Tech family offers some incredible privileges like hosting meetups, participating to intense coding parties and traveling around the world.

As part of our internal "Culture trips" program, my team, the Data team, had the chance
to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to attend the Strata+Hadoop world conference in
San José, California at the end of march 2016.

During one amazing week, we had the opportunity to talk data with the most active and
influent people in the tech community, get inspired by how the things are done in the Silicon
Valley and of course discover the beauty of California.

## Connecting to tech companies in the Valley

As everyone knows, every tech thing comes from San Francisco or the Silicon Valley.

This is why when you work for a tech company with high ambiition like Blablacar, you tend
to take use of the good practices, ideas and emerging technologies that the Valley produces.

Our first objective for this trip was to connect with tech guys working on data departments
to exchange on how both of our teams work, the benefits of each organizations and, because
at some points it matters, who had the biggest amount of data. Then, as soon as we got the keys
of our big (we were in America, everything's big there) car, we went to visit several cool
companies and people:

- Martin who is _data analyst_ at **Airbnb**. He explained how he and its team worked while tasting
a delicious breakfast served every day for all employees and their relatives

- Soucindar, data _scientist_ at **Twitch**, the video game streaming platform offered us to visit
their cool offices
- William, _product manager_ at **Google** introduced us to the Data Cloud Platform and all its components
- Guillaume, _architect / developer / data enginer / data analyst_ and another member of our strong French network in San Francisco, hosted us at **Textme**'s office
to explain how he created almost on its own a stable data platform while enjoying the view

## Talking data at the Strata conference

As the main reason of our venue, we spent two days attending to conferences and talks related to
Hadoop, and most widely to big data topics in San José during the Strata+Hadoop World, organized by O'Reilly.

For the 10th anniversary of Hadoop, 200 sessions and keynotes were scheduled, gathering
aroud 3000 attendees including data rock stars like **Jay Kreps** (creator of Apache Kafka),
**Holden Karau** (famous contributor of Apache Spark) and **Doug Cutting & Mike Cafarella**, the 2 fathers of hadoop and of course ... us!

Among trendy subjects were _streaming processing_, _self-service analytics_, _columnar database on Hadoop_ and _security_.

## California dreamin

On our free time, because work wasn't the only reason of our presence, we enjoyed the
city of San Francisco and its landscapes:

- the **Golden Gate bridge**
- the **Transamerica Tower** (and its incredible pyramid shape architecture)

- the famous San Francisco **cable cars** (we actually used Lyft instead, but it still worth a picture)

- the exotic **Pier 39** and its sea lions

We also took a tour on the pacific road in the data bus and experienced the California
dream from Santa Clara to Big Sur and through Carmel.

## Coming back more energized then ever

This once in a lifetime experience impacted us all when we came back to the office.

We realized that in a company like BlaBlaCar being _data driven_, our team is precious
and we already put in place good practices caught from Silicon Valley startups.

We started to convert all the energy and good ideas we sensed during our stay to
goals and projects, aiming to help Blablacar reach a bigger step.
