2014 was a great year for the Tech team of BlaBlaCar! Not only did we grow from about 20 people to
close to 50, but we also continued to live one of our key values: <strong>Share more, learn more</strong>.

Looking back at all the events, meet-ups and conferences where BlaBlaTechies assisted, produced a way bigger list than
expected: we **organised 3 events** in our lovely offices in the heart of Paris,

* Paris Android User Group (PAUG) meet-up, Paris (France) in March
* Sketch MeetUP, Paris (France) in September
* SfPot, Paris (France) in October
 
**sent people to 12 conferences in 5 countries** 

* SymfonyLive, Paris (France) in April
* PHP Tour Lyon (France) in June
* ForumPHP, Montrouge (France) in October
* Zabbix Conference, Riga (Latvia) in September
* Cassandra Summit, San Francisco (USA) in September
* Droidcon, Paris (France) in September
* Chef Community Summit, London (UK) in October
* Varnish Summit, Paris (France) in October
* appdays, Paris (France) in November
* Velocity Europe, Barcelona (Spain) in November
* SymfonyCon, Madrid (Spain) in November
* Cassandra Summit Europe, London (UK) in December
  
and **gave 14 talks** on conferences or meet-ups.

With this post I would also like to introduce <a href="/talks">a new section here on our blog: Talks</a>, the place to 
look for all our given talks & presentations. **2014 alone features 14 presentations**, feel free to flip through them.
