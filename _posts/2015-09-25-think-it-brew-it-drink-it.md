We love beer at BlaBlaCar, not everybody (which is perfectly fine) but many of us. Especially at the Tech team. You 
might have read or heard of the following lines, that conclude our [job descriptions](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/BlaBlaCar/85292466-php-symfony2-web-developer): *Last but not least you should have 
a favorite beer, a solid choice that you can explain and defend equally good in English or French, even after several of 
them ;)*

In May this year we all went to [the BAPBAP brewery](http://www.bapbap.paris/) as part of 
[a crowdfunding initiative](http://fr.ulule.com/bapbap/) supported by our CTO Francis Nappez and an internal team event.

An afternoon of beer understanding, preparing and brewing was followed by serious beer tasting. A few weeks 
(or better months) later we received around 250 bottles including [tons of swag from this new Paris-based brewery](https://twitter.com/BlaBlaCarTech/status/647064644184616960). A 
brainstorming session preceeded the delivery, since we needed to define our BlaBlaTech beer values just like [BlaBlaCar's 
culture values](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/blog/values).

    <span class="img-caption">One of the five values as a label</span>
</p>

We came up with the following set of 5 values:

* Think it. Brew it. Drink it
* In Beer we trust
* The Beer is the boss
* Beer is better than perfect
* Never Assume Always Taste

And those are now decorating the official BlaBlaTech beer!

The first beer batch has been brewed by us, and quickly consumed. We were in need for more and ordered a second 
batch, this time two different [BAPBAP blends](http://www.bapbap.paris/nos-bieres/): their Pale Ale *Originale* and 
their wheat beer *Blanc Bec*.

Eager to taste our brew? Just stop by at our stand at a future Tech conference in Paris or Warsaw and you are very likely to find a 
few bottles. Cheers!
