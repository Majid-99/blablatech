A few days ago [Nicolas Tricot](/authors/#author-nicolas-tricot) and myself went to Disneyland Paris, (unfortunately) not for roller-coastering but for speaking at [2015's ScrumDay conference](http://scrumday.fr/).

## Time travel

The event was actually a great opportunity to sit down and look back to tell the organisational story of BlaBlaCar's Tech team. And that's what we did! Once we got the invitation from the [French Scrum User Group](http://frenchsug.org/) —they actually motivated the talk and thus made all this happen, thanks a million for your invaluable support— we started to gather **information about the agile transformation of our tech organisation**, interviewed people and built the story.

Constructed around a timeline starting three years ago, we laid out the different stages of us being agile:

- not so much besides daily **standups** in 2012
- a little more with **user stories, velocity and complexity** in 2013
- fully scrum throughout 2014 with **poker planning and all the roles**
- perfect **scrumban and kanban** in 2015 with ever more mature teams

Have a look at our presentation embedded hereafter, a little over 70 slides (in French though) for a 40 minutes talk (which actually took as 42, of course ;).

## Outlook

The story continues, the BlaBlaTech team will continue to grow and evolve (stay tuned on this blog). So maybe **see you next year at the 2016 edition of Scrumday**, with another chapter and more learnings from a strongly growing agile tech organisation.
