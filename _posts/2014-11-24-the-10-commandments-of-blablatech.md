1. Thou shalt always think "Built To Last"
* Do not make a dirty fix when you know there is a more robust solution to the problem
* Comment your code so that it's understandable to other members of the team (and yourself) when they come across it later
* Learn from your mistakes and communicate on them ("Fail, Learn, Succeed")

2. Thou shalt never make changes directly in prod (Code of DataBase)
* Respect the rollout process:
  * [Dev + test] => [Preprod + tests] => [Prod + tests]
  * Backoffice and APIs are not exempt from this rule

3. Thou shalt respect the following principles of development: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) and SoC (Separation of Concerns)
* No wording to be displayed outside the translation table
* No style information outside the CSS files
* No HTML in your PHP files
* No Javascript validation without a corresponding server-side process

4. Thou shalt not take the team for your beta testers
* Do not submit something to other team members without having properly tested it on multiple browsers and multiple test cases ("Never assume, always check")
* Use your common sense and pass a critical eye over your code quality, architecture, design and ergonomics before delivering

5. Thou shalt put yourself in the place of the user
* Rejoice when a user writes to report a problem ("The member is the boss")
* Keep in mind that for every user who complains, 100 have had the same problem and not told us anything. A user who complains is, from his point of view, always right.
* Put yourself in the user's shoes by ridesharing ("Think it, build it, use it")
* Do not roll out something in production that goes against your common sense

6. Thou shalt respect our working methodology
* Do not deliver a feature for validation without first checking that it includes all the features originally requested by the PO
* Do not let the PO say the same thing twice
* Do everything possible to fulfill your team's commitments on the current sprint
* Do not start a big development without first discussing it with the team, PO and Scrum Master included ("Done is better than perfect")
* Do not bear any grudges - discuss any issues during the retrospective

7. Thou shalt ensure the prod functions properly
* Issues in production take precedence over everything else
* Always tell your PO which prod bug you're working on

8. Thou shalt foster a positive atmosphere within the team
* Reply to any messages you receive that contain a question
* Set comments in your commits
* Document and share information about new innovations that you come up with ("We are passionate, we innovate")
* Share your knowledge beyond the boundaries of the team if the opportunity arises ("Share more, learn more")
* Always use collaborative tools
* Give quick and constructive answers to the PR team's questions

9. Thou shalt understand how your work complements other teams
* Techs are attentive and talented people, otherwise they would not be here
* People from Marketing, Member Relations and Communication are the same...
* Always help people when they come to see you, or if you can't help, direct them to the person who can!

10. Thou shalt enjoy your work, otherwise it's not worth bothering with!
* If you're no longer enjoying your work, talk to your manager and/or Francis
* This approach is designed to help you enjoy everything you do, all the time!
