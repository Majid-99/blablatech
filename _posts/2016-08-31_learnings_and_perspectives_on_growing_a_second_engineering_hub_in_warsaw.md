description: Looking at fourteen months of having an engineering team in Warsaw.
---

Fourteen months ago I wrote about the beginning of our engineering hub in Warsaw, our second location in addition to headquarters in Paris. In the meantime BlaBlaCar continued to grow, and fast. So did the engineering team as well as the entire tech team, counting 100 engineers and 130 tech people respectively today. That’s quite some growth, and quite some challenge as well. With this article I’m aiming at sharing some learnings and perspectives of this growth, focusing on the challenge of living and working with two engineering hubs in Paris and Warsaw.

## Headcount evolution

Back to Warsaw, where the first person—[Piotr](/authors/#author-piotr-zarowny), see the last article’s section 6. Find the right leader—joined in May last year. I labelled him the best possible ambassador of the BlaBlaTech in Warsaw/Poland, and that’s what he kept being ever since. We quickly hired the first engineer—[Marek](/authors/#author-piotr-zarowny), who joined early July and whom we met at our first meetup as part of our efforts described in section 7. Integrate into the community. [Błażej](/authors/#author-blazej-kraszewski), [Wojciech](/authors/#author-wojciech-wiktorowicz) and [Michał](/authors/#author-michal-fikus) joined in September, and we kept on adding top talents to reach a total of nine engineers by the end of 2015. The team kept on growing throughout 2016, with today counting 20 engineers and an agile coach. Today we make no more difference whether a new engineering position is based in Paris or Warsaw, which will further help to grow the team and to eventually have its headcount catch up with the one in Paris.

## Towards autonomous teams

By the end of this year we’ll not only keep on hiring (and eventually have 25+ engineers in our Warsaw office) but also add other crucial roles like product managers, quality assurance specialists and ops. The latter effort is perfectly in line with our reorganisation end of last year—[read here how we’re organised & function today](/blog/blablanatomy)—that is strongly relying on autonomous full-stack teams. The goal is to always have squads—which are teams within our tribes—in one single location, something we’re slowly but surely achieving.

## Ongoing challenges
Having teams in two different locations is never as easy as being all together, nothing new here. The challenges we faced and solved were mainly linked to videoconferencing (thanks to Lifesize) and to team organisation (thanks to our switch to Tribes and Squads). Until we haven’t rendered squads fully independent—meaning having all required skills and roles united in one single location—we’ll keep on struggling with split teams and the discomfort of a few working with people and having dependencies that are far away. And getting there won’t come for free neither since it will require teams that are for now in one single location—like product, quality assurance or our ops—to have people in a distant office.

Having now many people from a different country and thus with different backgrounds also underlines cultural differences that pop up when working together on a daily basis. Language was the first obvious obstacle, but also the first to get removed quickly. Office hours is another, with very different lunch habits for instant between the French (where a déjeuner can last up to 1.5h, not to forget the coffee) and the Polish culture (where it’s about having lunch in mere 20 minutes). Fortunately both cultures are pretty close, and most attitudes and habits are actually shared (e.g. the mutual respect, valuing quality, or the thirst for our Thursday night drinks). 

## Joining the crew in Warsaw

First and foremost we’re very lucky to have extraordinary offices that also host the Polish marketing and community management team. And actually we’re even luckier, since those offices are filled with great colleagues. From a contract point of view we only offer job agreements, which aren’t very popular yet in Poland but actually come with some pretty interesting perks (like free shares for instance). 

Joining the BlaBlaTech team in Warsaw actually also means joining our Paris-based team. New joiners spend their first weeks in Paris, which remains an important part of their onboarding. On the other hand there are always people from Paris in Warsaw, multiplying in return the facetime with our engineers there. And just like for everybody who’s part of BlaBlaCar’s tech team, we highly value sharing and learning, with [countless conference participations in Europe and the US](/blog/share-more-learn-more-in-2015).
